ORIC specific build tools:

bin2tap: converts raw binary (and c64 format) to tape files.

I later found similar code but they didn't have the c64 
support for luna files anyway.

tap2dsk: creates a floppy image from tape files.
(c) F.Frances 2004

old2mfm: converts plain logical disk image to widely used mfm-encoded images.
